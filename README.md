This project aims to create a realistic Gravity simulator to use as a tool to create fun, educational and realistic space gameplay

The project currently contains the tools to help create a realistic space simulation. It contains a few scenes to demo the current features that are available.
You can currently create or use existing prefabs and set planet masses and have gravity be affected by those masses appropriately.
Orbits around planets can be easily acheived, however research into realistic velocity might be required to do things such as simulated our solar system.

I have no plans to continue developement of this project, but feel free to contact me if you have any questions about it or need help working with it if you choose to.
